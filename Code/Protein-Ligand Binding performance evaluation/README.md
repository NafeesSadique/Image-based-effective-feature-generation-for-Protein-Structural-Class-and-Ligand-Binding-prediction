# Instructions
1. "HybridLBP_(random).csv"  
    - randomly undersampled Hybrid LBP protein-ligand feature instances
2. "HybridLBP_(cluster).csv" 
    - clustering based undersampled Hybrid LBP protein-ligand feature instances
3. "CoMOG_PHOG_(random).csv  
    - randomly undersampled CoMOG & PHOG protein-ligand feature instances

***run "Protein-Ligand Binding (performance).py"
copy all data from "dump.txt" and paste in "Performance.xlsx" to measure algorithm's performance***


# Information				
1. ouput
   - "dump.txt" (outputs all together)
   - "Performance.xlsx" (category wise performance)
