# Image based effective feature generation for protein structural class and ligand binding prediction

This project is used to extract Hybrid LBP feature from pdb style files, predict protein class, predict protein ligand binding and evaluate performance of protein ligand binding for our bioinformatics research project on fast and efficient protein structural class and ligand binding prediction. The prediction can be found [Here](http://brl.uiu.ac.bd/PL/).

Each folder has their own `Readme.md` file to describe the codes.

All the data can be found in [Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FdMjz7pMMR6BFz7DyfcXlllHUg5KWtdU?usp=sharing) 

Details about this project can be found in [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/preprints/27743/)

For further query about the codes, please feel free to email.
